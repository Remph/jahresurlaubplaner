 * stretches, where the whole gap costs at most the limit. It must be worth a bridge: the joined
 * stretch contains a public holiday or special day off that falls on a working weekday, so plain
 * weekends are never suggested and a holiday on a day the user never works changes nothing.
 *
 * Only a whole gap counts, since taking part of it leaves a working day in the middle. A year's
 * bridges are those whose first day to take lies in that year. The stretch may reach into the
 * neighbouring years, so with `PublicHolidays.isHoliday` as [isPublicHoliday] the year before
 * the first supported year can be asked for and throws: use years after `FIRST_SUPPORTED_YEAR`.
 *
 * "Today" comes from [clock] and is used only by [best].
