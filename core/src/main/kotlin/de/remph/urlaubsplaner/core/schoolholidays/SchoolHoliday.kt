 * One school holiday period, or a single school-free day, of a Bundesland. [from] and [to] are
 * both inclusive and equal for a single day. The period can start in the year before or end in
 * the year after the one it is named for (Weihnachtsferien).
 *
 * The names come from the data file, in German and English, so the file can add a new kind of
 * holiday without a code change.
